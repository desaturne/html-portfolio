<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Times</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shersaah</h3>
<p>The film was well written, directed and acted. The songs of the movies were nice and the story was hooking. The feel of the movie was patriotic also because of real film locations.</p>
<h3>Jawan</h3>
<p>Again, the storyline and acting was a par in this movie. The strong message in the film and the ever so popular King of Romance SRK doing action was huge plus point.</p>
<h3>Gangubai Kathibaadi</h3>
<p>The movie was entirely of Alia Bhatt. The actress showed emotions in such a brilliant way and also the direction and script of the movie was outstanding.</p>
